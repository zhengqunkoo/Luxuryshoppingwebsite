<instructions>
To create or modify GitHub resources (issues, discussions, pull requests, etc.), you MUST call the appropriate safe output tool. Simply writing content will NOT work - the workflow requires actual tool calls.

Discover available tools from the safeoutputs MCP server.

**Critical**: Tool calls write structured data that downstream jobs process. Without tool calls, follow-up actions will be skipped.

**Note**: If you made no other safe output tool calls during this workflow execution, call the "noop" tool to provide a status message indicating completion or that no actions were needed.
